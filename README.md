# Better Filtering for LinkedIn Job Search

## overview
linkedin job search functionality makes me sad, so i built this extension to potentially make me less sad.

## features
- hides extraneous data from job list items (other people who went to same college, benefits info, skill badges, etc.)
- the built-in 'on-site/remote' filter excludes any listings where on-site/remote/hybrid is not specified. this extension allows those results to appear, but hides any where 'on-site' or 'remote' is specified.
- the built-in NOT search operator doesn't seem to work very well, so this allows you to filter out job titles that contain specified keywords
- right click a company name and select option to hide any jobs from that company from your search results
- highlight promoted jobs in a different color

## installation
1. install as unpacked chrome extension

## todo
- make on-site/hybrid/remote configurable
